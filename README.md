Instructions

- I have implemented dynamic chart with plain PHP and Google Graph
- You just have to put the whole code in the main directory of the server to install it


- I used two grpah types (pie and bars)
- To test this: https://658181bc.dorsy.net/
    => I have used sample query which is found sample_query_multiple.sql
    => and V axis with "location" and Legend "day"
    => and with Chart Type "multiple" and Graph Type "Line" or "Bar"
- and also for other test with pie chart
    => I have used sample query which is found sample_query_single.sql
    => and with Chart Type "single" and Graph Type "Pie"
